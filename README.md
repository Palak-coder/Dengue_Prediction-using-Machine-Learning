# Dengue_Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This complete project is on Dengue prediction using Machine Learning with different parameters like age, body temperature, blood sugar, blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) etc.
We tried various algorithms out of which Decision Tree algorithm gave the highest accuracy of 92%.
